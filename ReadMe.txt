Hi, thanks for viewing my Notes Application.
This is built on Node.js and you can do:

1. Adding a note to make a task.    Command: node app.js add --title="Eat Pizza" --body="It's Yummm"
2. Removing a note for the task that is done.   Command: node app.js remove --title="Eat Pizza" --body="It's Yummm"
3. Viewing your currently added notes.  Command: node app.js list
4. Reading a particular note that you created.  Command: node app.js read --title="Eat Burgers"

Thanks for trying this out, I hope you like it.
